  <p>Like many websites, the site inventures.fund can store or retrieve information from your browser, usually in the form of cookies.</p>

  <p>The use of cookies on our site is used mainly to improve the user’s experience during their visit by offering them a more personalized experience leading to more efficient and fluent navigation.

  <dl>
    <dt class='bold py1'>Essential cookies</dt>

    <dt class='bold py1'>Connecting cookies</dt>
    <dd>Certain site pages require you to log on as a member and will generate specific cookies (including storing a username during registration on the site as a member). These cookies are retained for a 2 month period.</dd>

    <dt class='bold py1'>Convenience cookies</dt>
    <dd>Certain cookies are used to store the navigation language on the site and personalize the page, by taking into account previous consultations. The primary purpose of these cookies is to contribute to the ease of the site’s navigation. They can also contain useful information such as a member’s current subscriptions, a list of the documents stored in a personal workspace, etc. These cookies are preserved to be supplemented or refreshed on subsequent visits. The browser settings allow you to control cookies, and their removal does not prevent the proper use of the site.</dd>

    <dt class='bold mb1'>Statistical or analytical cookies</dt>
    <dd>These cookies collect information on the site usage (pages visited, average duration of consultations, …). The statistical analysis is strictly anonymous and enables us to identify the most and least visited pages and get to know about the overall site usage habits. This is also the means of detecting site navigational difficulties and assessing the advertising effectiveness of the companies displayed on the site. For some analyses, we use Google Analytics which can be disabled in different ways depending on the browsers used (modules and third-party extensions, site blocking google-analytics.com/*). The data collected by the site in this way is in principle aggregated and processed anonymously. These cookies are retained for a maximum period of 2 years.</dd>

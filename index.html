<h3>Our investment strategy</h3>

<p>Inventures is open to invest in European impact businesses: larger amounts in confirmed scale-ups (50%), and smaller amounts in a number of start-ups (20%) with reinvestment in follow-up rounds (30%).</p>

<p>Inventures II always requests a seat in the board of directors of each business in its portfolio.</p>

<p>Both Inventures I & II empower citizens and help to democratize venture capital by offering co-investment on a crowdfunding platform, MyMicroInvest.</p>

<p>Including citizens in a multi-stakeholder partnership reinforces the selection of companies, and increases the chances of success by creating a large community of ambassadors sharing the same values.</p>

LOGO I

<p>Inventures I is a €15 Million fund that focuses on seed, early stage and growth businesses, and has selected 15 companies for investment.</p>

<p>See the portfolio here. The fund is now closed to new businesses, but Inventures II is just getting started.</p>

LOGO II

<p>Inventures II SDG Growth is a venture capital fund currently accepting new investment. The fund has raised €15 Million so far, and aims to raise €50 Million. The fund will invest in 35 promising start-ups and scale-ups with a high growth potential. Inventures II is unique because it focuses on businesses that positively impact the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>

<h3>Co-investing with crowdfunding</h3>

<p>Inventures is unique because it is coupled with crowdfunding, to gauge the market for each business by testing it with co-investment.</p>

<p>Crowdfunding is a collective investment in a business or product. Equity crowdfunding allows the public to participate in venture capital by purchasing Notes for small amounts (currently €100), which when added together in our experience, can reach a larger amount of €50,000 – €4 Million.</p>

<p>Our team believes convincing the crowd to invest with crowdfunding will prove a market potential or fit. Crowdfunding helps a business to build a community of ambassadors, and generate positive marketing effects. Further, an early go-to-market experience is better than a late project crash, after years of investment and reinvestment.</p>

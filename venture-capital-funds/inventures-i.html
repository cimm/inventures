<h2>Story and figures</h2>

<p>The fund Inventures was founded in 2011 by Olivier de Duve, who worked in venture capital in Europe and the US. He was working and living abroad and became concerned with youth employment, especially when considering his children’s future. For the next generation to have good jobs in Europe, investment in small companies is crucial. Together with several friends and former colleagues, he founded Inventures and MyMicroInvest to tackle this problem.</p>

<p>Inventures I is a €15 Million fund that focuses on seed, early stage and growth businesses, and has selected 15 companies for investment. Active since 2012, the fund invested in businesses that focused on societal goals including: health, education, environment, well being. The fund is dedicated to early-stage businesses (40%) and growth-stage businesses (60%).</p>

<h2>Investment strategy</h2>

<p>Inventures I was designed to improve our world by enabling great entrepreneurs. As a result, the fund focuses on solutions, products or services, that contribute to solving societal problems. Specifically in the following industries: health, education, environment, society, environment and economy.</p>

<p><strong>Co-financing with the crowd</strong> – The innovative feature of Inventures is that it includes citizens in a multi-stakeholder partnership, through the crowdfunding platform MyMicroInvest.

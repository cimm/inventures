<h2>Story</h2>

<p>The challenges of development today underline the shortfall of basic needs affecting millions of people and major critical environmental issues.</p>

<p>Governments have adopted policies and frameworks to incentivise the development of sustainable businesses all around the world. This has particularly been detailed in the 2016 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>

<p>The SDGs build on the principles of “The Future We Want”, and have been supportive of the often-quoted UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon who believes that “we don’t have plan B because there is no planet B”.</p>

<p>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), officially known as Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is composed of 17 “Global Goals” with 169 specific targets.</p>

<p>Creating the SDGs was a collaborative process involving the 193 UN Member States, as well as global civil society.</p>

<p>The resulting detailed SDGs are a broad intergovernmental agreement that acts as the Post 2015 Development Agenda (successor to the Millennium Development Goals).</p>

# Inventures

The fourth incarnation of the Inventures website.

The Inventures website is a responsive static website hosted on Github Pages and lives at http://inventures.fund. It has some general information about the Inventures I and II funds.

## Limitations

- We can't use SSL on Github Pages when using a custom domain.
- We can't use HAML since Github Pages does not support extensions.
